== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Multilanguage plugin translate website content automatically? =

Yes, you can add Google Auto Translate switcher using widget or via the corresponding shortcode.

= How do I change the language my content is displayed in? =

You can change content display language through the widget, which is activated automatically when you activate the plugin if you have an active sidebar. If you have several active sidebars, the widget is added to the sidebar, which features a search widget. But if you do not have an active sidebar, you need to create it and add Multilanguage widget manually.

= Where do I get these language packs of the extra languages? =

You can find all official translation files in [WordPress language repository](http://i18n.svn.wordpress.org/).

= So whenever I change the language for my content, WordPress localization in the frontend also changes? =

In the plugin settings, you can enable/disable an option to switch WordPress localization when the language is changed in the frontend. If you enable this option, you must install additional language packs for WordPress to have this function working. However, in the backend, WordPress localization corresponds to the default language, and cannot be changed.

= There is no adding block for Multilanguage switcher in Edit Menus =

It seems like this block is disabled in Screen Options of your page. Please open Screen Options on the page (in the upper right corner of the screen) and enable Multilanguage checkbox.

= Can I use Multilanguage plugin on a multisite? =

Yes, you can use Multilanguage on a multi-site without any problems as well. The plugin settings on each site will be unique.

= How can I add more alternate links for current page? =

You can use 'bwsplgns_mltlngg_add_alt_links' filter to do that. For example, you want that search engines firstly indexed exactly English-language pages of your site for people from New Zealand and South Africa. Just add the following code into "functions.php" of your theme:

`function get_additional_links( $links_attr ) {
	/* English for New Zealand */
	$links_attr[] = array( 'hreflang' => 'en_NZ', 'link_param' => 'en_GB' );
	/* English for South Africa */
	$links_attr[] = array( 'hreflang' => 'en_ZA', 'link_param' => 'en_GB' );
	return $links_attr;
}
add_filter( 'bwsplgns_mltlngg_add_alt_links', 'get_additional_links' );`

Note: before you have to choose English (for England) as one of languages of your website.

= I added several whitespaces between words during the post content editing in the text mode. They are gone after I switched to the visual mode. Why? =

After the mode switching, the post content has been automatically filtered to remove all odd symbols or HTML tags which can disrupt pages layout on your website. This functionality is related to WordPress core and our plugin does not affect it in any way.

= When title and content is empty, none of the changes get saved when I update the post =

When title and content fields in active language tab are empty when you are trying to update the post after editing, the changes will not be saved and an error message will appear. You need to fill at least one field or switch to another language tab (which contains some content in the specified input fields) and try to update once again.

= How can I change element's style in the frontend for certain language? =

"mltlngg-{current language slug}" class type has been added to &lt;body&gt; tag for an ability to stylize content of certain language. For example, if you want to set a green color for &lt;p&gt; when the English language is selected, it is necessary to:
1. Go to WordPress admin panel "Multilanguage" -> "Custom Code";
2. Check off "Activate" in "Editing bws-custom-code.css" block and enter the following code:

`.mltlngg-en_US p {
	color: green;
}`

3. Save changes.

= How can I add a language that is not in the list? =

You can add the necessary language by adding the appropriate line with language data to "languages.php" file (wp-content/plugins/multilanguage/include/languages.php).
Follow the next steps:
1. Find the wp-content/plugins/multilanguage/include/languages.php using the FTP software.
2. Open the languages.php file in a text editor.
3. Add a language following the example of others from the list.
4. Save changes.
5. Add the corresponding flag icon image (png, 16x11px) to the 'images/flags/' folder using the FTP software.

When done, update the plugin settings page and you'll see the added language in the languages list.

In order to find the correct language name and language locale please visit the following page: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>

= I have some problems with the plugin's work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support? =

Please make sure that the problem hasn't been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem's description:
- The link to the page where the problem occurs
- The name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version - your order number.
- The version of your WordPress installation
